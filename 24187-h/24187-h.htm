<p class="fgcap"><span class="dcap">he</span> rugged little stellar
scout ship flared down
to the surface of Kappa
Orionis VII about a
mile from the aboriginal
village. The pilot, Lieutenant
Eric Haruhiku, scorched an open
field, but pointed out to Louis Mayne
that he had been careful to disturb
neither woodland nor shoreline.</p>

<p>"The Kappans are touchy about
those, Judge," he explained, "They
fish a lot, as you'd guess from all
these shallow seas, and they pick
fruit in the forests; but they don't
farm much."</p>

<p>"No use provoking trouble," Mayne
approved. "It's a long way from
Rigel."</p>

<p>"It's a longer way from Sol," said
the pilot.</p>

<p>"Don't I know, boy! If it weren't,
I'd be just another retired space captain,
quietly struggling with my ranch
on Rigel IX. As it is, to get the grant,
I had to remain on call as an arbitrator."</p>

<p>"Somebody has to settle these
things," said Haruhiku. "There's not
much law way out here, except what
the Space Force can apply. Well, if
you'll excuse me, sir, I'll have them
get out the helicopter and take us
over to the village."</p>

<p>"Let me see that last message
again, before you go," Mayne requested.</p>

<p>The pilot extracted a sheet from
his clipboard and handed it to Mayne
as he left. Mayne studied the text
with little pleasure.</p>

<p>Terran Space Force headquarters
on Rigel IX wished to inform him
that the long awaited envoy from
Terra to Kappa Orionis VII not only
had arrived but had departed two
days behind Mayne.</p>

<p>It was hoped, the communication
continued, that nothing would interfere
with the desired objective of
coming to some friendly agreement
with the Kappans that would permit
Terran use of the planet as a base for
spaceships. The envoy, of course, was
prepared to offer trade inducements
and various other forms of help to the
semi-civilized natives. Mayne was requested
to lay whatever groundwork
he could.</p>

<p><i>In my spare time, no doubt</i>, he
reflected. <i>I'm to settle this silly business
any way at all&mdash;as long as the
natives get their way. But has anybody
told the government about insurance
companies? If it costs money
or a lawsuit, will they back me up?</i></p>

<p>He felt himself to be in a ridiculous
dilemma. The Kappans were reported
to have seized a Terran spaceship
as it landed to trade. Naturally,
the captain had squawked for help.
He claimed he had crashed; his insurance
company thought otherwise;
the Kappans seemed to have some
entirely different idea in mind. Mayne
had been summoned into action to
render a decision, after the rough and
ready system of these settlements on
the surface of Terra's sphere of explored
space.</p>

<p>Regretfully, he made his way now
to the cubbyhole allowed him on the
cramped scout, where he changed to
a more formal tunic of a bright blue
he hoped would look impressive to
native eyes. By the time he was ready,
the helicopter was waiting. He and
Haruhiku entered, and the crewman
at the controls took off for the scene
of the dispute.</p>

<p>Arriving over the village, they hovered
a few minutes while Haruhiku
studied the lay of the land. The lieutenant
had been to this world before,
long enough to pick up some of the
language and customs, so Mayne was
content to follow his advice about
landing a little way off from a spaceship
that towered outside the village.</p>

<p>They came down about a hundred
yards away, between a rutted sort of
road and a long hut covered by a
curved, thatched roof.</p>

<p>"They're expecting us," said Haruhiku,
gesturing at the group before
the hut.</p>

<p>It consisted of half a dozen humans
and several of the Kappan natives.
The latter, naturally, caught Mayne's
eye first. The most imposing individual
among them stood about five feet
tall. The planet being of about the
same mass as Terra, the Kappan probably
weighed over two hundred and
fifty pounds. He was a rugged biped
with something saurian in his ancestry;
for his skin was scaled, and bony
plates grew into a low crown upon
his long skull. His arms and legs
were heavy and bowed, with joints
obscured by thick muscles and loose
skin. Mayne was struck by the fancy
that the Kappan's color, a blend of
brown and olive, was that of a small
dragon who had achieved a good suntan.
A yellow kilt was his main article
of attire, although he wore a few
decorations of polished bone.</p>

<hr />

<p>One of the Terrans stepped forward.
He wore a semimilitary uniform.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're Louis Mayne?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Right," answered Mayne. "You
would be Captain Voorhis, of the
<i>Gemsbok</i>?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/002.png" width="448" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Check. This here is Eemakh. He's
more or less chief of the village, or
tribe, or whatever you wanna call it."</p>

<p>Mayne found his gaze sinking into
catlike slits of jet in a pair of huge
orange eyes shaded by massive brow
ridges. The native made some statement
in a clicking language that had
a harsh, choppy rhythm.</p>

<p>"He welcomes you to Kappa,"
Haruhiku interpreted. "He hopes
the gods will not be displeased."</p>

<p>"What a warm welcome!" commented
Mayne. "Have you been
getting along that well, Captain
Voorhis?"</p>

<p>"Just about," said the spacer. "One
of my boys knows a few words. Rest
of the time, we make signs. I gotta
admit they ain't been too unfriendly."</p>

<p>"But they <i>have</i> seized your ship?"</p>

<p>"You're damn' right! That insurance
guy they sent out don't see it
that way though."</p>

<p>"Where is this representative of
the Belt Insurance Company?" asked
Mayne.</p>

<p>"Melin? His ship landed over on
the other side of the village, about
half a mile. He oughta be along soon.
Must've seen you land."</p>

<p>Mayne wondered whether it were
necessary to await the arrival of the
insurance adjustor before asking any
questions. To cover his hesitation, he
turned to take his first good look at
the hull of the <i>Gemsbok</i>.</p>

<p>"What do they think they're doing?"
he demanded, staring.</p>

<p>The <i>Gemsbok</i> was&mdash;or had been&mdash;an
ungraceful, thick starship on the
verge of aging into scrap. Towering
here between the village and the
huge, bluish-green leaves of the Kappan
forest, she was in the process of
being transformed into a planet-bound
object of a certain weird
grace.</p>

<p>A framework was being constructed
about the hull by a swarm of
natives. They had reached halfway
up the ship, which served as a central
column. Much of the exterior appeared
to be a network of strangely
curved sections of wood that had been
given a high polish. Mayne suspected
the greenish highlights were reflections
of the forest color.</p>

<p>"Bone," said Voorhis succinctly.
"They collect it from things they
catch in the sea. Main supports of
timber, of course, built to fit the
hull."</p>

<p>"The fish here grow very large,"
put in Haruhiku. "If you could call
them fish, that is. I once saw them
butchering what looked more like a
dinosaur."</p>

<p>Mayne realized that the bone
framework formed a sort of curtain
wall. At the lower levels, some of the
natives seemed to be experimenting
with a coating of wet leaves which
they were molding to the wall.</p>

<p>"They've soaked them in something
they boil out of fish parts," his
pilot explained. "Like the village
roofs. When it dries, it's pretty hard,
even waterproof. The stink never
dries out."</p>

<p>"But what do they have in their
bony little brains?" asked Mayne.
"Just what is that mess supposed to
be?"</p>

<p>"A temple, believe it or not," answered
Voorhis. "They tell me I set
her down on land sacred to the great
god Meeg!"</p>

<p>Mayne looked at Haruhiku.</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, now! I came all the
way from&mdash;" He stopped as he noticed
the pilot's grave expression.
"Oh! That sort of thing <i>could</i> be
serious, I guess."</p>

<p>He imagined he had seen the chief,
Eemakh, come alert at the mention
of the local god. Mayne sighed. It
was going to be a long day.</p>

<p>He was saved for the time being
by a hail from the direction of the
village. A procession was approaching
along the set of ruts between Mayne
and the ship.</p>

<hr />

<p>The place of honor appeared to be
occupied by a two-wheeled cart of
crude but massive design. Upon it
rode a Kappan driver, two Kappans
with spears and the look of official
guards, and a Terran with a death-grip
upon the side railing. A brace
of truculent beasts of frighteningly
saurian mien shuffled ponderously
along in the loose harness. From time
to time, one or the other would stumble
over a turn in his rut and emit
a menacing rumble as if he suspected
his team mate of causing the misstep.</p>

<p>Before and behind this conveyance
marched a guard of honor of Kappan
warriors. The rear contingent kept
close to the cart, but the advance
party had opened a noticeable gap
between themselves and the hulking
team.</p>

<p>The procession halted, the soldier
in charge raised his spear in salute to
Eemakh, and the shaken Terran was
assisted to dismount. He introduced
himself to Mayne as Robert Melin.</p>

<p>"Let's go over to the hut they made
for us an' sit down," suggested Voorhis.</p>

<p>Melin, a tall, gloomy blond whose
civilian suit seemed a trifle formal for
the surroundings, acceded gratefully.
He mopped the dust from his long
face and watched the cart being turned
around.</p>

<p>The procession moved off in the
direction of the village, the advance
guard stepping out especially smartly,
and Mayne began to get his conference
arranged.</p>

<p>He learned that the evicted crew of
the <i>Gemsbok</i> had been living in the
hut nearby. Before it stood a long
table with benches, all evidently
knocked together from recently felled
timber. Melin was given credit for
this by Voorhis, since before the arrival
of the insurance adjuster and his
crew, no power tools had been available
to the men from the <i>Gemsbok</i>.</p>

<p>Mayne took a place at the end of
the table. Some of the <i>Gemsbok's</i>
crew came out of the hut to watch.
Most of the Kappan warriors attending
the chief took up stations between
the table and the ship, in a manner
suggesting long habit. Mayne guessed
that attempts had been made to re-enter
the ship.</p>

<p>He put Haruhiku at his right hand
to translate should it be necessary.
Melin and Voorhis sat at his left,
their backs to the hut. To the other
side of the table, Eemakh brought
two Kappans who were explained to
Mayne as being the tribal high priest,
Igrillik, and Kaynox, who represented
a sort of district overlord.</p>

<p>"I meant to land up by <i>their</i> city,"
Voorhis put in, "but we hit some bad
winds up in the stratosphere. We got
knocked around a bit in the storm,
and set down where we could."</p>

<p>"Well, tell me about the details,"
said Mayne. "I want to get this
straight from the start, if I can. By
the way, Lieutenant Haruhiku, explain
to the chief that a special envoy
is on the way, that we want his
friendship, and that he will be dealt
with fairly."</p>

<p>He waited out the exchange of
choppy speech between the pilot and
Eemakh.</p>

<p>"He says he is sure he will be
fairly dealt with," reported Haruhiku.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he meant by that,"
murmured Mayne. "If we make a deal
here, and thereby with his overlord,
will that cover enough territory to be
official?"</p>

<p>"As much as you can get together
anywhere on this world, sir."</p>

<p>Mayne nodded, then turned to
Captain Voorhis.</p>

<p>"Now about this so-called crash?"
he prompted.</p>

<p>"Well, there was this storm, like
I said. Trouble was we didn't expect
to hit it and ... well ... somebody
took it in his head to blow some of
the fuel tanks for a crash landing.
That's why I'm not claimin' anythin'
on the fuel," he finished, turning to
Melin.</p>

<p>"We are perfectly willing to pay
on that item," replied the insurance
man.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," continued Voorhis, "I
set down here where we saw the open
spot, an' then of course we were stuck
with nothin' to lift off with. It looked
all right. We'd unload our goods, an'
if the local crowd couldn't use them
all, why they'd pass the rest on at a
profit to themselves. So we come out
to palaver, an' then they won't let us
go back in the ship. We were just
lucky my com man had sent out a
landing report when it looked like
we piled up, or the Space Force patrol
never woulda heard of us."</p>

<p>"Was there any trouble?" asked
Mayne. "Any unnecessary hostility?"</p>

<p>Voorhis considered, rubbing the
back of his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Well ... I suppose, lookin' at it
their way, they coulda been a lot
rougher. A couple of punches got
thrown, an' one of my boys got a
spear busted over his head, but mostly
they acted ... well ... maybe
more like cops than cannibals."</p>

<p>"Just enforcing the native laws,
eh?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Voorhis did not swallow that quite
so graciously. He did not know or
care what the local laws might be,
but he thought it suspicious in the
extreme that he should have plopped
down exactly upon the spot chosen
by the natives for a temple.</p>

<p>"So do they have to use my ship
to hang it on?" he finished plaintively.</p>

<p>"The company is in agreement with
you there, captain," Melin put in.
"You see, Judge, our point is that
nothing is really lost or seriously damaged,
neither ship nor cargo. They
are merely being withheld from their
rightful owner, and we believe that
puts the responsibility for recovery
upon the Terran government. Captain
Voorhis has our entire sympathy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yeah!" said Voorhis. "An' if I
get my head sliced off tryin' to get at
that undamaged cargo, you'll come to
my funeral! I say it's a loss!"</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen!" interrupted
Mayne. "Let me get on with this.
Both of you, I'm sure, realize that I'm
not a lawyer in spite of being a special
judge. If the colonies way out
here had enough lawyers to spare, I
certainly wouldn't be sticking my
head into this. Nevertheless, any decision
I make here will be regarded
as legally binding by the government
of Rigel IX, so let us remain level-headed."</p>

<p>"Very well, Judge," said Melin.
"Here are the figures on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please round them off," said
Mayne. "If I have to listen to a long
list in centicredits, I'll probably go
off to see what kind of beer they
brew here."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like it," muttered
Voorhis, staring sourly at the village.</p>

<p>"No doubt," grinned Mayne.</p>

<p>Melin swallowed and returned to
an inner pocket a sheaf of papers he
had withdrawn.</p>

<p>"Speaking very loosely," he went
on, as if hating to do anything loosely,
"the coverage was about as follows:
for the <i>Gemsbok</i> herself, two
million; but that was really a nominal
figure accorded as a sort of courtesy.
Otherwise, at her true worth, the
authorities would hardly have permitted
Captain Voorhis to take her into
space&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get on with it," urged Mayne, to
forestall any wrangle.</p>

<p>"Er ... yes. Then on the cargo,
the purchase cost of two hundred
thousand credits."</p>

<p>Voorhis visibly flinched and began
to acquire a ruddy hue.</p>

<p>"And, finally, on the fuel load, the
cost price of three hundred thousand.
Of course, Judge, there are detailed
clauses as to normal use of fuel. He
was actually insured against defects,
premature explosions, accidental loss,
et cetera."</p>

<p>Mayne did some addition in his
head.</p>

<p>"So your company," he said aloud,
"is prepared to pay two and a half
million for the loss sustained by Captain
Voorhis. What seems to be
wrong with that?"</p>

<p>Both men began to talk but Melin,
struggling less with temper, got the
lead.</p>

<p>"Actually," he said, "we feel liable
for only three hundred thousand."</p>

<p><i>Now it will get tough</i>, thought
Mayne. He silently awaited elucidation.</p>

<p>The combined stares of all parties,
including the enigmatic glance of
Eemakh, calmed the spluttering Voorhis.
Melin continued.</p>

<p>"In the first place, the true value
of the ship, even if we consider her
to be incapacitated&mdash;which we do not&mdash;is
only about one hundred and
fifty thousand."</p>

<p>"She's worth more than that as
scrap!" bellowed Voorhis.</p>

<p>"No, captain, just about that. It is
exactly how we valued her. Do you
have any idea, Judge, of how old that
crock is?"</p>

<p>"Let's not go into that just yet,"
suggested Mayne.</p>

<p>"As to the fuel," said Melin, "I
am willing, as a gesture of good will,
to stick my company's neck out&mdash;and
mine with it, you may be sure&mdash;and
honor a full claim."</p>

<p>"Even though he used about half
the fuel getting here?" asked Mayne.</p>

<p>"We'll ignore that. We admit that
he is out of fuel, and we want to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You want to give me a moon and
take a star," said Voorhis.</p>

<p>"Just a minute!" Mayne held up
his hand. "That's the ship and the
fuel. What about the cargo?"</p>

<p>"Why, as to that, Judge, we do not
admit that it is lost. It is right over
there, easily accessible. We consider
it more the job of the Space Force to
restore rightful possession than it is
the responsibility of the company to
reimburse Captain Voorhis for the
inflated value he sets upon it."</p>

<p>"I begin to see," murmured Mayne.
"You can't stick each other, so you're
out to slip <i>me</i> the bill."</p>

<p>That aroused a babble of denials.
Mayne eventually made himself heard
and demanded to know how the
spacer's evaluation differed from Melin's.
Voorhis pulled himself together,
glowering at the insurance man.</p>

<hr />

<p>"In the first place," he growled,
"I don't want his lousy payment for
fuel. I said I'd take the blame for
that, an' I will. On the ship ... well,
maybe she ain't worth two million.
Maybe she ain't been for a few years
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Melin made a show of counting
on his fingers.</p>

<p>"... But they charged me
premiums by that figure an' I say
they oughta pay by that figure."</p>

<p>"But can you prove she's a total
loss, captain?" asked Mayne.</p>

<p>Voorhis grimaced and spat upon
the ground.</p>

<p>"Try to get near her, Judge! You'll
get proof fast enough!"</p>

<p>"Well ... about the cargo,
then?"</p>

<p>"<i>That's</i> where he's gouging me!"
exploded Voorhis. "The idea of
using the cost as of loading on Rigel
IX! Hell, you know the margin of
profit there is in trading on these
new planets, twenty to one at least.
I figured to lift off with four million
worth of ores, gems, curios, and
whatnot."</p>

<p>"So your point is that the mere
transportation of the goods through
space to this planet increased their
value. What about that, Mr.
Melin?"</p>

<p>Melin shifted uncomfortably on
his bench. Mayne would have liked
to change his own position, but
feared splinters.</p>

<p>"There is an element of truth in
that," admitted Melin. "Still, it
would be rash to expect such a return
every time a tramp spaceship lands
to swap with some aboriginal easy
marks."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Mayne, "that our
orange-eyed friends speak no Terran?"</p>

<p>"I hope not!" exclaimed Voorhis.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," Melin said after
a startled pause, "how can we be
expected to pay off on hopes? He
wants the paper figure for the ship;
but he refuses the paper figure for
the cargo."</p>

<p>Mayne shrugged. He turned to
Haruhiku.</p>

<p>"If Captain Voorhis and Mr.
Melin don't mind, lieutenant, I'd like
to get the chief's view of all this."</p>

<p>"Hah!" grunted Voorhis, clapping
both hands to his head.</p>

<p>Melin contented himself with
rolling his eyes skyward.</p>

<p>With Haruhiku translating,
Mayne began to get acquainted with
the Kappans. The visitor from the
neighboring city chose mostly to listen
attentively, but Igrillik, the
priest, occasionally leaned over to
whisper sibilantly into Eemakh's
recessed ear. Mayne fancied he saw
a resemblance between the two, despite
Igrillik's professional trappings&mdash;a
long robe of rough material that
had been dyed in stripes and figures
of several crude colors, and a tall
cap to which were attached a number
of pairs of membraneous wings.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 529px;">
<img src="images/003.png" width="529" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The first thing that Mayne learned
was that the <i>Gemsbok</i> was not a
spaceship; it was a symbol, a sign
sent to the Kappans by the great god
Meeg.</p>

<p>"And why did he send it?" asked
Mayne.</p>

<p>He had sent it as a sign that he
was impatient with his children.
They had vowed him a temple, they
had set aside the necessary land, and
yet they had not begun the work.</p>

<p>"Is that why they're all over there,
slaving away so feverishly?"</p>

<p>It was indeed the reason. After
all, Meeg was the god of the inner
moon, the one that passed so speedily
across the sky. If he could guide
the strangers' ship directly to his own
plot of ground, he might just as
easily have caused it to land in the
center of the village. They had seen
the flames that attended the landing.
Could the honored chief from the
stars blame them for heeding the
warning?</p>

<p>"I see their point," muttered
Mayne resignedly. "Well, maybe we
can talk sense about the cargo. Tell
them that there is much in the holds
that would make their lives richer.
Tools, gems, fine cloth&mdash;give them
the story, lieutenant."</p>

<p>This time, Eemakh conferred with
the high priest. It developed that the
cargo was a sacred gift to be used or
not as the god Meeg might subsequently
direct. The chief meant no
insult. The Kappans realized that
Voorhis and his crew were no demons,
but starmen such as had often
brought valuable goods to trade. The
Kappans had not sought to harm or
sacrifice them, had they? This was
because they were both welcome as
visitors and respected as instruments
of Meeg.</p>

<p>Eemakh wished to be fair. The
starmen might think they had lost
by the divine mission. Very well&mdash;they
would be granted land, good
land with forest for hunting and
shoreline for fishing. But go near the
temple they should not!</p>

<p>"Could <i>I</i> get in to inspect the cargo?"
asked Mayne.</p>

<p>Haruhiku took this up with the
Kappans, who softened but did not
yield.</p>

<p>"The best I can get, Judge," said
the pilot, "is that they wish it were
possible but only those who serve the
purposes of Meeg may enter."</p>

<p>"They <i>would</i> look at it that way,"
sighed Mayne. "Let's leave it at that,
until we can think this over some
more. It's time for a lunch break
anyway."</p>

<hr />

<p>He and Haruhiku were flown back
to the scout ship. Mayne brooded silently
most of the way. Voorhis
thought he was entitled to about six
million credits for ship and cargo;
Melin thought half a million for the
ship and fuel would be stretching it.
Mayne foresaw that he would have
to knock heads.</p>

<p>The two of them lunched in the
pilot's cabin, with hardly room to
drop a spoon. Except for companionship,
Mayne would as soon have
eaten standing in the galley.</p>

<p>He considered the vast area of the
planet's land surface. Would it be
wiser for the envoy to land elsewhere?
What sort of ties were there
between tribes?</p>

<p>"Loose," the pilot told him. "Still,
word gets around, with no great
mountain or ocean barriers. They've
split into groups, but there is a lot
of contact."</p>

<p>"So if the Space Force should seize
the <i>Gemsbok</i>, they'll all hear about
it?"</p>

<p>"Within a few weeks, sir. That
kind of news has wings on any
world. I think we could take her for
you, but we might do some damage.
The size of a scout crew doesn't lend
itself to hand-to-hand brawls."</p>

<p>"And if you sling a couple of torpedoes
at the Kappan village, you'll
probably wipe it out," said Mayne
thoughtfully. "Give the story a
month to spread, and no Terran
would be trusted anywhere on the
planet. Hm-m-m ... hardly practical!"</p>

<p>"There would also be a chance of
damaging the <i>Gemsbok</i>."</p>

<p>"Actually, Eric, I'd hardly care if
you blew her into orbit, with Voorhis
and Melin riding the fins! But I'm
supposed to spread sweetness and
light around here&mdash;not scraps and
parts of spaceships."</p>

<p>He gnawed moodily upon a
knuckle, but saw no way to escape
putting up some government money.
Soaking the company would just
make <i>them</i> appeal instead of Voorhis.</p>

<p>"This Meeg," he said to change
the subject. "How important is he?"</p>

<p>Haruhiku considered a moment
before replying.</p>

<p>"They have a whole mess of gods,
like most primitive societies. Meeg
is pretty important. I think he has a
special significance to this tribe ...
you know, like some ancient Terran
cities has a special patron."</p>

<p>"He's the god of that little
moon?" Mayne asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, more than that, I think.
Really the god of speed, a message
bearer for the other divinities. There
always seems to be one in every
primitive mythology."</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Mayne. "Let's
see ... one parallel would be the
ancient Terran Hermes, wouldn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Something like that," agreed
Haruhiku. "I'm a little vague on the
subject, sir. At least, he isn't one of
the bloodthirsty ones."</p>

<p>"That helps," sighed Mayne, "but
not enough."</p>

<p>He got a message blank from the
pilot. With some labor, he composed
a request to Terran headquarters on
Rigel IX for authorization to spend
two million credits on good-will
preparations for the Terran-Kappan
treaty conference.</p>

<p><i>It almost sounds diplomatic</i>, he
told himself before having the message
sent.</p>

<p>The waiting period that followed
was more to be blamed upon headquarters
pussyfooting than upon the
subspace transmission. When an answer
finally came, it required a further
exchange of messages.</p>

<p>Mayne's last communique might
have been boiled down to, "But I
<i>need</i> it!"</p>

<p>The last reply granted provisional
permission to spend the sum mentioned;
but gleaming between the
lines like the sweep of a revolving
beacon was a strong intimation that
Mayne had better not hope to charge
the item to "good will." The budget
just was not made that way, the hint
concluded.</p>

<p>"It's due to get dark soon, isn't
it?" he asked Haruhiku, crumpling
the final message into a side pocket.
"I don't believe I'll resume the talks
till morning. Maybe my head will
function again by then."</p>

<hr />

<p>In the morning, one of the scout's
crew again took the pilot and Mayne
to the meeting by helicopter. Mayne
spent part of the trip mulling over
a message Haruhiku had received.
The spaceship <i>Diamond Belt</i> could
be expected to arrive in orbit about
the planet later the same day, bearing
special envoy J. P. McDonald.
The captain, having been informed
of Haruhiku's presence, requested
landing advice.</p>

<p>"I told him what I know," said
the pilot. "We can give him a beam
down, of course, unless you think we
should send him somewhere else."</p>

<p>"Well ... let's see how this goes,"
said Mayne. "They seem to be waiting
for us down there."</p>

<p>They landed to find Voorhis, Melin,
and the native officialdom gathered
at the hut facing the new
"temple." After exchanging greetings,
they sat down at the table as
they had the day before.</p>

<p>"All right, gentlemen," said Mayne
to the two Terrans. "You win. The
government is going to have to put
something in the pot. I want to make
it as little as possible, so let us have
no more nonsense about the true
value of ship or cargo as they stand."</p>

<p>They looked startled at his tone.
Mayne went on before they could
recover.</p>

<p>"The object I have in mind, if it
seems at all possible, is to put Captain
Voorhis back in business without
costing Mr. Melin his job. Now, let's
put our heads together on that problem
and worry about justifying ourselves
later."</p>

<p>The most difficult part was to convince
Voorhis to surrender his dream
of fantastic profits; but sometime before
Mayne got hoarse, the captain
was made to see that he could not
have his cake and eat it, too.</p>

<p>Melin agreed that he might pay
the paper value of the <i>Gemsbok</i> if
he could pay likewise for the cargo,
in which case he would admit a loss.
After all, a spaceship anchored by a
temple might reasonably be termed
unspaceworthy. He would take over
the cargo and cut his losses by allowing
the government to buy it at two
million.</p>

<p>"You wanna come with me next
trip?" invited Voorhis when he
heard this. "If that's how you cut
loose, we'll make a fortune!"</p>

<p>"Well, there it is," said Mayne,
straightening up to ease his aching
back. He must have been leaning
tensely over the table longer than he
had thought. "The captain gets two
and a half million, Mr. Melin gets
off with paying only half a million,
and you've stuck me for the rest."</p>

<p>"Congratulations, Judge!" said
Melin. "You now own a ship and
cargo which I presume you will present
to the Kappans."</p>

<p>"How can he?" demanded Voorhis.
"They figure they own it
already."</p>

<p>"We'll worry about that later,"
said Mayne.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> will!" Voorhis guffawed. "I
hope you get <i>some</i> credit out of it."</p>

<p>Haruhiku interrupted to inform
Mayne that the Kappans, who had
been interested if bewildered listeners,
had invited the Terrans to a
small feast.</p>

<p>"I translated enough to let them
understand there would be no attempt
to disturb their temple building," he
explained. "They now feel they owe
us hospitality."</p>

<p>"Good, that's something," said
Mayne.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what else will be
something," grunted Voorhis. "The
food!"</p>

<p>The assemblage repaired to the
Kappan village. The Terrans&mdash;though
it took some doing&mdash;survived
the feast.</p>

<p>Mayne thought it best not to inquire
into the nature of the dishes
served. Eemakh was evidently determined
to display his village's finest
hospitality, so the Terrans even tried
the Kappan beer. Mayne absorbed
enough to get used to it.</p>

<p><i>Or did it absorb me?</i> he wondered.
<i>Igrillik's beginning to look
almost human!</i></p>

<p>Eventually, carts were brought,
and they rode bumpily out to admire
progress made on the temple.
A fresh breeze helped Mayne to remember
that it was now late afternoon
and he had yet to settle one
matter with Eemakh.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the site,
crewmen from the <i>Gemsbok</i> saw fit
to take Voorhis in charge and carry
him into their hut. Mayne sank
down at the table outside, watching
Melin grope to a place beside him.
He noticed that Haruhiku's helicopter
pilot handed him a message as soon
as the lieutenant alighted.</p>

<p>"That will be from the <i>Diamond
Belt</i>," Mayne guessed.</p>

<p>He eyed Melin with some amusement.
The insurance man stared very
quietly at the board beneath his elbows.
His complexion held a tint of
green. Even Eemakh, plodding ponderously
up, lowered himself to a
bench with a sigh. The high priest
seemed less affected by the celebration,
and Mayne was proud when
Haruhiku walked over with his normal
bland alertness.</p>

<p>"They're getting near?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Doing braking circles," reported
the pilot. "I sent an order for the
scout to give them a beam. There
may still be time to send them somewhere
else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One more try here first," Mayne
decided. "Tell Eemakh we want to
straighten out some confusion about
Meeg and the cargo."</p>

<hr />

<p>Haruhiku permitted himself a
small shrug and translated. Eemakh
aroused himself to a show of interest,
while Igrillik turned a suspicious
orange stare upon Mayne. The latter
strove to frame in his mind an argument
that would strike them as logical.</p>

<p>"Tell him," he instructed, "that
we believe this Meeg was known on
Terra, but by another name. Then
describe the mythical Hermes and
see what he says."</p>

<p>Haruhiku began a conversation
that lasted several minutes. Igrillik,
as an authority, obviously felt moved
to deliver a lengthy opinion. At last,
the pilot turned to Mayne.</p>

<p>"They say we are to be congratulated,"
he reported.</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Well, they do seem a bit more
friendly. I was going to try drawing
a picture of that famous statue, with
the winged heels and hat, but it
would never match their own conception.
Igrillik asks if you claim belief
in Meeg."</p>

<p>"Avoid that," said Mayne. "Now&mdash;do
they know about ship communications?"</p>

<p>"They are aware that it is done,"
said Haruhiku. "After all, they just
saw me send a message to the scout
over the helicopter screen."</p>

<p>"Good! Point out to them that the
<i>Gemsbok</i> also has such equipment."</p>

<p>Haruhiku engaged in another long
talk. The Kappans began to show
signs of uneasiness at the end. They
remained silent.</p>

<p>"And that therefore," added
Mayne, "the Terran who served this
machine should rank in their eyes
as a servant of Meeg just as much
as Igrillik. The cargo in the ship
was no more his than a message belongs
to the messenger bearing it."</p>

<p>The pilot put this into Kappan,
with gestures.</p>

<p>"And furthermore," said Mayne,
before it could be suggested that the
owner might be Meeg, "what I have
arranged here with Melin and Voorhis
is that the cargo now belongs
to all of the Terran people."</p>

<p>Eemakh began to scowl, an impressive
contortion on a broad, olive
Kappan visage. Mayne hurried on.</p>

<p>"This being the case, the Kappans
<i>have absolutely no right</i> to deny us
the privilege of contributing all these
goods to the glory of their temple!"</p>

<p>"Oh, boy!" grunted Haruhiku. He
rattled off the translation.</p>

<p>Mayne watched it hit home. Igrillik
leaned over to peer at him unbelievingly.
Eemakh seemed to have
difficulty in focusing his glowing
eyes on the Terran.</p>

<p>There were, of course, requests for
clarification. Mayne left the repetitions
to the pilot.</p>

<p>In the end, Eemakh arose and
embraced him, a startling action that
left Mayne feeling introspectively of
his ribs. Igrillik called out something
to the bodyguard attending the chief,
causing Mayne to repress a shudder
at the flashing display of big Kappan
teeth. He assumed that a smile
was a humanoid constant.</p>

<p>Haruhiku's pilot approached with
a new message.</p>

<p>"Now they have to land near here,
in half an hour or less," said the
spacer.</p>

<p>"There's just one more thing,"
Mayne told him. "Voorhis is satisfied,
Melin&mdash;look, he's gone to sleep
on the table!&mdash;is relieved, the Kappans
are friendly, and J. P. McDonald
will be happy when he lands.
Now I have to get myself off the
hook for two million!"</p>

<p>He turned to the <i>Gemsbok</i> crewmen
loitering before the hut.</p>

<p>"Who was the communications
man?" he demanded.</p>

<p>A lean, freckled youth with a big
nose admitted to the distinction.
Mayne draped an arm about his
shoulders and told him he was back
in business.</p>

<p>"Say to them," he instructed
Haruhiku, "that if they are to learn
how to use the equipment Meeg has
provided for their temple, they must
not delay one minute in taking our
friend here into the ship ... uh ...
make that 'temple.' He will show
them how a spaceship is called down
from the skies."</p>

<p>Haruhiku gave him a straight-faced
glance that was a masked guffaw.
He translated, and orders began
to be shouted back and forth among
the Kappans, all the way to the top-most
level of the construction. The
lieutenant called his pilot.</p>

<p>"I'll have him flash the scout an
order to monitor the <i>Gemsbok</i> and
transfer landing control as soon as
they hear her on the air," he explained.</p>

<p>Mayne nodded. He clutched the
arm of the <i>Gemsbok</i> operator, who
was being urged away by Igrillik and
a group of warrior escorts.</p>

<p>"Just one thing, son," he shouted
over the babble. "Forget about the
ship's call sign. You go on the air
calling yourself Kappa Orionis Central
Control."</p>

<p>"Kappa Orionis Central...?"
repeated the youth distrustfully.</p>

<p>"You've got it," said Mayne, and
shoved him on his way. He turned
to Haruhiku. "The last thing to do
is to send the helicopter for some
paint. I don't care if it <i>isn't</i> dry
when the <i>Diamond Belt</i> touches
down&mdash;I want a sign over the door
of this hut!"</p>

<p>"A sign?"</p>

<p>"Make it read 'Spaceport Number
1.' Two million is cheap enough
for buying a spaceport already in
operation. There won't be any trouble,
since the Kappans promised the
land."</p>

<p>Everyone seemed to be running
somewhere. Mayne wiped his face
with a handkerchief and sat down
beside Melin, who looked comfortable
enough with his head on the
table.</p>

<p>From inside the hut, Mayne could
hear snores that must have Voorhis
as a source; the rest of the <i>Gemsbok</i>
crewmen had followed the crowd to
the control tower that was also a
temple. After a while, Haruhiku returned
and sat down across from
Melin.</p>

<p>"Magnificent, Judge!" he said.
"We might even get away with
it."</p>

<p>"Of course we will," said Mayne,
gazing at Melin and listening to
Voorhis. "After all, Hermes was the
god of thieves, too!"</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
